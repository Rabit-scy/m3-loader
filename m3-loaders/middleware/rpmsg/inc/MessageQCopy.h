/** ============================================================================
 *  @file       MessageQCopy.h
 *
 *  @brief      A simple copy-based MessageQ, to work with Linux virtio_rp_msg.
 *
 *  The following are key features of the MessageQCopy module:
 *  - Multiple writers, single reader.
 *  - Timeouts are allowed when receiving messages.
 *  - Supports processor copy transfers only.
 *  - Sending/receiving also works between enpoints on the same processor.
 *
 *  Non-Features (as compared to MessageQ):
 *  - zero copy messaging, using registered heaps.
 *  - Dependence on a NameServer (Client furnishes the endpoint IDs)
 *  - Arbitrary reply endpoints can be embedded in message header.
 *  - Priority Queues.
 *
 *  Conceptually, the reader thread owns a message queue. The reader thread
 *  creates a message queue. The writer threads opens a created message queue
 *  to get access to it.
 *
 *  Message queues are identified by a system-wide unique 32 bit queueID,
 *  which encodes the (MultiProc) 16 bit core ID and a local 16 bit index ID.
 *
 *  The MessageQCopy header should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/ipc/rpmsg/MessageQCopy.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Questions:
 *  - Workout how connections exist: how does Ducati side cleanup when Linux
 *    side goes down?
 *  - Client needs to know max size of data buffer to allocate for receive.
 *  - Do we need procID's buried in the message header addresses anymore, or
 *    isn't that now implicit in the vrings/transport.
 *  - Do we want MessageQ_Unblock in this version?  (Normally used in RCM).
 *  - Do we want the generic ISync ability to create our own synchronizers,
 *    or just hard-code semaphore usage or callbacks for simplicity?
 *
